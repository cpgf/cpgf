2017-03-25 version 1.6.0
	Now the library requires C++11.
	Rewrote the callback system using C++ variadic template.
	Rewrote GVariant using C++ variadic template.
	Optimized script binding performance. Now the performance is a little more than doubled.

	Script binding, now script can inherit from C++ class. Available in Lua, V8, and SpiderMonkey.
	Added script context in script binding.
	Added customized value converter in script binding.
	In GMetaType, added function baseIsStdString and baseIsStdWideString to determine if a meta type is std::string or std::wstring.
	Added VC 2012 and VC 2013 entries in build makefile for easy use.
	Added source group in CMake build file to filter files better in VC IDE.
	Optimization in script binding. Now the script objects are reused when possible when passing C++ objects to the script engine. Slightly lower memory and higher performance.

	Fixed a memory leak in V8 script binding when constructing V8 object from C++.
	Fixed a bug that the script instance cache may cause crash when the library is shutting down, due to unordered uninitialization.
	Fixed a bug that script function can't live after its owner script object is freed. Now script function can have its own lifetime.
	Build config, removed "-D_SECURE_SCL=0 -D_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0" in VC building to avoid linking error with third party libraries.
	Build config, building with nmake will generate cpgf.lib in folder lib/Debug/ or lib/Release/, instead of lib/

2013-07-26 version 1.5.6
	Added Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript binding. Only tested on Windows with VC.
	Added GScriptValue to represent values in script binding.

		GScriptObject::gainScriptFunction was renamed to getScriptFunction, and the return value was changed to GScriptValue.
		GScriptObject::createScriptObject result type was changed to GScriptValue, which stores an interface IScriptObject.
		In GScriptObject, the function bindXXX (such as bindClass) and getXXX (such as getClass) are now deprecated. They will be removed in the future. Use GScriptObject::getValue and GScriptObject::setValue instead.
		Removed file gfunctionextractor.h and function extractFunction, use gselectfunctionbyarity.h and selectFunctionByArity instead.

	Improved meta traits.
	Now in reflection, the base meta class can be resolved correctly even it is reflected later than derived classes.

2012-09-22 version 1.5.0
