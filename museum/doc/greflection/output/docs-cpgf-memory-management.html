<h1>cpgf library memory management guideline</h1>

The design goal of cpgf library memory management is to ease memory management and avoid memory leak.<br />
There is slight different rule between class and function based API (classes name starts with G) and interface based API (classes name starts with I).<br />
<br />
Note here is only discussing the object that allocated on the heap, not any auto object that allocated on the stack.<br />
So the object dicussed here is passing by pointer, not by reference or by value.<br />
<br />
<b>Memory management rules in class and function based API </b><br />
<br />
Rule 1, every object has explicit, one, and only one owner.<br />
Rule 2, the owner must free the object when the object is not used any more.<br />
Rule 3, the owner can transfer the ownership to another, then the original owner loses the ownership and won't free the object.<br />
<br />
cpgf library uses different function name prefix to distinguish the ownership.<br />
<br />
A function name prefixes with &quot;create&quot;, or &quot;gain&quot;, will transfer the ownership to the caller.<br />
So if you are invoking createScriptObject (in class GScriptObject and IScriptObject), you must free the returned object when it's not used.<br />
<br />
A function name prefixes with &quot;get&quot;, or any other non-&quot;create&quot; and non-&quot;gain&quot;, will hold the ownership.<br />
So if you are calling any getMetaXXX functions in GMetaClass, you must NOT free the returned object.<br />
<br />
To be exception safe, a scoped smart pointer, the one in cpgf called GScopedPointer, is your friend.<br />
<br />
<b>Memory management rules in interface based API </b><br />
<br />
Rule 1, every object uses reference count to manage the object life cycle.<br />
Rule 2, there is no explicit owner for any object.<br />
Rule 3, for any object returned by any API, after it is not used, releaseReference of the object must be called.<br />
<br />
So no matter what's the functions named, releaseReference must be called.<br />
<br />
To be exception safe, a scoped smart pointer GScopedInterface is provided.<br />
