<h1>Building and use cpgf library</h1>

<h3>Using the library </h3>
<ol><li>	In the project setting, add an include path pointing to &quot;cpgf/include&quot;.
</li><li>	Link the source code or link the library in your project.	
</li><li>	All classes, functions and APIs are in the namespace &quot;cpgf&quot;.
</li></ol>	

<h3>Link the source code </h3>
	To using the library, the easiest way is to just link all .cpp source code<br />
	under the src and sub folder.<br />
	However, a build script is also provided to build the code as static library.<br />
	<br />

<h3>Build the library </h3>
	The library uses CMake as the build system.<br />
	A makefile is provided to wrap the CMake build.<br />
	To build the library, open command line terminal, go to folder &quot;build&quot;,<br />
	<br />
	make PLATFORM<br />
		<br />
	PLATFORM can be one of<br />
		nmake mingw linux vc05 vc08 vc10 cb_mingw cb_nmake cb_linux<br />
		<br />
	For detailed PLATFORM information, run &quot;make&quot; without parameter to see<br />
	the help.<br />
	<br />
	If you are using MSVC, run &quot;nmake&quot; instead of &quot;make&quot;.<br />
<br />
	To build with Lua binding, you must change the variable LUA_DIR<br />
	in build.config.txt to point to the source code of Lua.<br />
	<br />
	To build with Google V8 Javascript binding, you must change the variable V8_DIR<br />
	in build.config.txt to point to the source code of V8.<br />
<br />
	To build the unit test and sample code, feed a second parameter<br />
	<br />
	make PLATFORM TARGET=TheTarget<br />
<br />
	TheTarget can be,<br />
	lib -- Build the library. This is the default if TARGET is omitted.<br />
	test -- Build the unit test.<br />
	samplereflection -- Build the reflection sample application.<br />
	samplelua -- Build the Lua binding sample application.<br />
<br />
<br />
