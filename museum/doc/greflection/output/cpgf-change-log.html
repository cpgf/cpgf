<h1>cpgf library changes log</h1>


<h3>2012-07-28 version 1.4.5 </h3>
<ul><li>	Fixed a bug that in V8 binding, passing existing C++ object to script will cause a new object is created.
</li><li>	In script binding, now script function can override C++ virtual member functions.

<ul><li>	Script binding supports wide string (wchar_t *) in method parameters and return value.
</li><li>	vtByteArray is removed from GVariant.

</li><li>	Lua binding, fixed a bug that no exception was thrown when assigning to enumerator value.
</li><li>	Refactored the script binding engines a lot.
</li><li>	Added code for tutorials in samples folder.
