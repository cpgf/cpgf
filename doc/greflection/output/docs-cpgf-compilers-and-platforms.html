<h3>cgpf library portability and compatibility -- tested supported C++ compilers and platforms</h3>

<br />
Below table shows the tested platforms and C++ compilers that cpgf works on.<br />
In summary, if you are working on Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, and using the compilers MS VC 2008 or newer, GCC 3.4.2 or newer, cpgf library will work for you.<br />
And your target platform is not limited to Windows, Linux or Mac. It can be mobile phones, embeded deviced, game consoles, as long as it has a compiler supported in the list.<br />
<br />
From version 1.2.3, cpgf also supports Embarcadero C++ Builder (tested with version 2010).<br />

<b>Notes: </b><br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Compile clean&quot; means succeeding the compiling and linking, no errors or warnings after enabling all warnings. </b><br />
Google V8 v8.h will introduce warnings but that's not counted to cpgf.<br />
<br />
<b>The working compilers and platforms are not limited to the list in the table. </b><br />
The table only shows the compilers and platforms that had been tested.<br />
The other not too old compilers in GCC, VC family should work well too. Not too old means not as old as VC 6 or GCC 2.9.5.<br />
<br />
<b>Intel C++ Compiler is super slow to compile cpgf. </b><br />
It uses more than 2 hours to compile the unit tests while GCC and VC only need 10~20 minutes.<br />
Not sure it's because that the compiler is quite slow to compile template code, or because it's run in Ubuntu which is running in Virtualbox (but GCC in Ubuntu + Virtualbox is quite faster).<br />
<br />
<b>C++ Builder is not fully tested. </b><br />
Seems C++ Builder is quite lame and doesn't have the ability to compile quite complicated source file.<br />
For some unit test, the compiler always throws errors, such like &quot;E2491 Maximum VIRDEF count exceeded&quot;, or internal error. All are the compiler's internal limitation.<br />
So some unit test for reflection, such as method or operator, most tests are removed in C++ Builder.<br />
Also script binding is not tested in C++ Builder, because it will be hard to build Lua and V8 library using C++ Builder.<br />
In brief, only 40% of the total unit tests are used to test cpgf in C++ Builder.<br />
So if you want to use cpgf in C++ Builder, take your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Not all compilers are tested for compatibility in every cpgf release. </b><br />
Due to the frequently library releasing, and the huge work/time on testing all compilers listed above, in each release, not all compilers are tested.<br />
So if you find any supported compiler failed to compile the library, please forgive it kindly and notify me for the issue.<br />
Up to now, it's only guaranteed that GCC 4.6 and VC 2008 are used to test every release.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Your help is wanted. </b><br />
If you approve that cpgf library works on other compilers or platforms, please let me know!<br />
Especially non-VC and non-gcc compilers are interested, such as Intel compiler.<br />
Also non-Windows, non-Linux and non-Mac platforms are interested, such as mobile phones, game consoles (Wii, WiiU, NDS, 3DS, XBox 360, PS3, PSP), or embeded system.<br />
Also more 64 bit tests are interested.<br />
