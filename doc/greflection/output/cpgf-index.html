<h1>cpgf library -- a free C++ open source library for reflection, serialization, script binding, callbacks </h1>

cpgf is a free, open source and cross platform C++ library.<br />
cpgf is composed by several independent components:<br />
<ul><li>	cpgf reflection -- a library to add	reflection feature to C++.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf serialization -- a library to save C++ data and objects to persistent storage and then load back.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf script binding -- a script binding engine to connect Lua, Google V8 Javascript and Python to C++. It's based on the reflection library.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf callback -- a callback library to implement signal/slot or callback in C++. It's the primary library for other libraries.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf meta data collection -- a library with built-in meta data support. Now there are meta data for C++ STL, OpenGL, OpenGLU, OpenGLUT, Box2D physical engine and SFML multimedia library.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf meta data generator tool -- a tool written in Java to automatically generate meta data from Doxygen XML files.
</li></ul>The goal of cpgf is to extend C++ language with lots of easy to use features, which are only available in other higher level languages and absent  in C++.<br />
cpgf provides a powerful reflection and meta data system. Have you ever envied the reflection system in C# and Java? Now we have it in C++!<br />
cpgf provides a very easy to use serialization system. Want the the same serialization system that is in C# and Java? Now we have it in C++!<br />
cpgf makes binding Lua, Google V8 Javascript, and Python to C++ a piece of cake! The script binding engine extensively uses the reflection system.<br />
cpgf provides a very easy to use callback system, which is commonly used in C# and script languages.<br />
Want to use OpenGL, Box2D and SFML in Lua, Javascript and Python? It is very simple and easy using cpgf.<br />
<br />
<b>Vesion 1.4.4 is released on Jun.30, 2012. </b><br />
<br />

<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul><li>	<b>Provide easy to use class and function based library. </b>
</li>
<li>	<b>Also provide interface based, Windows COM style, binary compatible API. </b> It's easy to put meta data in a dynamic library and use the meta data from within another library.
</li>
<li>	<b>Written in standard and portable C++. </b> It can be compiled in VC 2008, GCC 3.4.2, Intel Composer XE 12.1.2 and C++ Builder 2010, on Windows, Linux, and Mac (iOS, iPhone, iPad).
</li>
<li>	<b>Extensively, but not abuse, using template programming. </b> 
</li>	
<li>	<b>No need external preprocessor or code generation tools. </b> Just coding and enjoy. Easy to setup, easy to integrate with your project.
</li>	
<li>	<b>Free and open source. </b>
</li></ul>

<h3>Quick facts of reflection library</h3>
<ul><li>	As powerful as the reflection system in Java and C#.
</li><li>	Reflect global/member functions, global/member fields (variable), global/member properties (fields with getter/setter), constructors, classes, enumerators, and annotations.
</li><li>	Real runtime reflection. No compile time template parameters are needed when using the reflection.
</li><li>	No external preprocessor required, no ugly macros. Only using C++ templates, classes, and functions.
</li><li>	Support multiple inheritance.
</li><li>	Support default parameters for constructor, method, and operators.
</li><li>	For more information, please read cpgf reflection related documentation.
</li></ul>
<h3>Quick facts of serialization library</h3>
<ul><li>	As powerful as the serialization system in Java and C#.
</li><li>	Serialize object graph.
</li><li>	Correctly resolve multiple pointers to same object.
</li><li>	Serialize polymorphic objects.
</li><li>	Serialize C++ array.
</li><li>	Very extensible. The library supports customized serializer to serialize special data type manually.
</li><li>	Storage format agnostic.
</li><li>	Versioning.
</li><li>	Doesn't require extra intervention. Serialization only depends on relection meta data.
</li><li>	For more information, please read cpgf serialization related documentation.
</li></ul>
<h3>Quick facts of script binding library</h3>
<ul><li>	Support Lua 5.2 and 5.1, Google V8 Javascript, and Python 2.7.3.
</li><li>	Very easy and simple to use. Any reflected meta data can be bound to scripts.
</li><li>	Bind C++ classes, enumerators, functions, variables and operators to Lua, Google V8 Javascript and Python.
</li><li>	Invoke Lua, V8 Javascript and Python functions from C++.
</li><li>	Pass function written in script to C++ and used by C++.
</li><li>	Get and set Lua, V8 Javascript and Python variables from C++.
</li><li>	Transfer arbitrary binary data between C++ and script.
</li><li>	Pass arbitrary script function and object to C++.
</li><li>	For more information, please read cpgf script binding related documentation.
</li></ul>

<h3>Compatibility -- Tested compilers and platforms </h3>
	Support GCC 3.4.2 and up, MS VC 2008 and up, C++ Builder 2010 and up, XCode and Intel C++ Compiler.<br />
	<a href="docs-cpgf-compilers-and-platforms.html">Read this document for more information </a><br />

<h3>Required third party library -- None for the primary libraries </h3>
	Doesn't require C++0X, TR1 or C++11 features.<br />
	Doesn't require Boost library.<br />
	For Lua binding, Lua library is required.<br />
	For Google V8 Javascript binding, V8 library is required.<br />
	For Python binding, Python library is required.<br />
	If you want to run the unit test, UnitTest++ is required. But usually you don't need to do that.<br />
	<br />
	

<h3>Learning the library </h3>
	Though there are some documentations on this website, they are far from good.<br />
	They are incomplete, and not quite native reading.<br />
<br />
	The fastest way to get start with the library is to read the sample code in the folder &quot;samples&quot;.<br />
	The sample code was originally written for test purpose, so they are not as easy to read as you expect. But they covers most features so it's a good kick off.<br />
	<br />
	If you want to read more sample code, read the code in the folder &quot;test&quot;.<br />
	They are for unit test. They are much more difficult to read and they use a lot of macros.<br />
	However, they cover much more functions than the sample code.<br />
	<br />
	
<h3>How is the library tested </h3>
	Several measures are adopted to test the library.<br />
	Unit test -- hundreds of unit tests were written and ran. More unit tests are being added for existing code and new code.<br />
	Valgrind -- valgrind is used to check memory leaks and other memory problems (wild pointer, double free, etc).<br />
	Code coverage -- GNU gcov is used to check the code coverage in unit tests. The ultimate goal is to cover all API functions and 80% implementation code. Though we didn't achieve the goal yet, we are closing to it day by day.<br />
	<br />

<h3>Contribute to the library </h3>
	If you like the library and want to contribute to it, here are some most desired work to do<br />
	1, Use the library in your real project. That will help the library much. A library is nothing without real projects using it.<br />
	2, Help with the documentation. I'm not a native English speaker, and I also don't enjoy writing documentation.<br />
	3, Test the library on more compilers and platforms, especially on 64 bit platforms and compilers.<br />
	<br />

<h3>What does cpgf mean? </h3>
	The original cpgf means Cross Platform Game Framework.<br />
	It was intended	to be game framework that can work on PC and smart phone.<br />
	But later I decided to add more fun but non-game features to the library.<br />
	So now the library is neither for game nor a framework.<br />
	It's a cross platform C++ library.<br />
	<br />
