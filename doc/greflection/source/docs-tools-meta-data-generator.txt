Metagen is a tool to generate meta data from Doxygen XML automatically and generate the corresponding C++ code.
The tool itself is writter in Perl, tested with Perl 5.8 on Windows and Perl 5.10 on Ubuntu.
The tool require XML Dom package which may be not in your Perl default installation.

To use this tool, you need very basic Perl knowledge to understand the config file format which is a piece of Perl script.

The tool is in folder cpgf/tools/metagen.
The Box2D meta data generator is in folder cpgf/tools/metagen/metagen_box2d, there are Doxygen project, metagen config file, and shell script to execute the tool. The are good sample for start.

<{autobr}>
The tool uses Doxygen XML files for C++ code information.
The tool only needs the code information, so your C++ code is not necessary Doxygen documented.
If you are going to generate meta data for a library, all header files with public API should be included in the Doxygen project, otherwise, base classes information may be missed.

Below listed Doxygen tags and values which required by metagen and has non-default value.

EXTRACT_ALL = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC = YES
SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES = NO
GENERATE_TODOLIST = NO
GENERATE_TESTLIST = NO
GENERATE_BUGLIST = NO
GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST = NO
SHOW_USED_FILES = NO
SHOW_FILES = NO
REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = NO
VERBATIM_HEADERS = NO
GENERATE_HTML = NO
GENERATE_LATEX = NO
GENERATE_XML = YES
XML_PROGRAMLISTING = NO

Metagen needs a config file to obtain necessary information.
The config file itself is a Perl script with a variable named $config, which is a hash reference.
$config contains several key-value pairs.

There is a config.default.pl in the tool package, the keys in it are documented.
Also config.box2d.pl in Box2D generator is a good use case.

Beside $config, any valid Perl code can be put into the config file, such as temporary variable, sub routines, etc.

Note: don't prefix $config with "my". $config should not be local variable.

<{sh}> Tool command line options
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
To execute the tool, run,
perl metagen.pl
Then it will display usage information.
Note for Unix/Linux user, don't try to run the script directly. Use Perl to invoke it. There is no the "#!" first line in the script to indicate for the intercepter.

Metagen takes two must-have options.
--xml DoxygenXMLFileName
--config ConfigFileName

DoxygenXMLFileName can be any valid Doxygen XML file name. But usually it should be the index.xml.
The tool will parse the XML file, and all XML files it references to. So a index.xml is enough to parse all library.

ConfigFileName is the config Perl script.

There are two optional options, --headerOutput and --sourceOutput.
If they are provided in the command line, they will override the same name config in the config file.

Here is the command line used to generate meta data for Box2D, as an example,
<{piece}>perl ../metagen.pl --xml xml/index.xml --config config.box2d.pl <{/piece}>

<{/autobr}>



<{sh}> The status and capability of the tool
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
Currently metagen has basic features.
It succeeds on generating meta data for Box2D physical engine.
So for simple library, the tool should be quite useful. "simple" here means no need for scripting, or need scripting but no event or callback system and no a lot need to override virtual functions in script, etc.

Now the tool can only generate meta data, it can't automatically deal with special case for scripting usage, such as wrap operator to functions.

If you are going to generate meta data to use in script, here are some limitations:
1, The tool can't wrap operator to functions, such as add "inc" function for "++" operator. This will be supported in near future.
2, The tool can't help to let script override C++ virtual functions. This will be supported in the future.
3, The tool can't handle script callback as we did in Glut binding manually. This may be supported in the future.

The future goal of the tool is to be able to generate script usable meta data for wxWidgets or equivalent complex libraries.
