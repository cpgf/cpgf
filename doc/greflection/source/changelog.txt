<h3>2012-07-07 version 1.4.4 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Script binding supports wide string (wchar_t *) in method parameters and return value.
	vtByteArray is removed from GVariant.
	Now script binding doesn't auto convert IByteArray * to void *, the script should use IByteArray::getMemory to pass the pointer.
	Lua binding, fixed a bug that no exception was thrown when assigning to enumerator value.
	Refactored the script binding engines a lot.
	Added code for tutorials in samples folder.

<{/autoul}>

<h3>2012-02-26 version 1.3.0 </h3>
<{autoul}>

	Added a sample application for Box2D binding.
	Now the OpenGL metadata can be compiled with GCC.
	Added the OpenGL sample to cmake build file.
	Added policy GMetaPolicyDestructorAbsent to allow meta data for class with private destructor.

	Added "dangle" and GDefineMetaDangle.
	Added function getStdTypeInfo to GTypeInfo to get C++ type info.
	Removed all virtual functions from meta templates to reduce code bloat (the unit test executable size is decreased by 10%).
	Fixed a bug that _class prototype in GMetaDefine is wrong.
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2012-02-05 version 1.2.5 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Support parameters default value for meta invokable. Method, constructor and object functor operator.
	Refactored GMetaEnum to remove unnecessary code.
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2012-01-28 version 1.2.4 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Added meta data for OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT.
	Added binary data support (via IByteArray) in script binding.
	Added a sample application to show how to use OpenGL in Lua and V8 Javascript.
	Extended meta enum to accept a GVariant. Now meta enum can be not only integer, but also float, pointer, string, etc. Useful to reflect constants.
	Fixed a bug in V8 binding that enum value can't be accessed through class.
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2012-01-24 version 1.2.3 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Added script function wrapper. Now script can pass script function to C++ as method parameters.
	Added script object wrapper. Now script can pass script object to C++ as method parameters.
	Added meta data for STL iterator, vector, list and deque.
	V8 binding -- Added object property enumerator. Now using for..in will enumerate all meta data in the object.
	Added policy GMetaRuleGetterExplicitThis and GMetaRuleSetterExplicitThis for property getter and setter.
	Added vtInterface in GVariant.
	Improved code portability, now the library can compile in Intel C++ Compiler Composer XE and Embarcadero C++ Builder 2010.
	Fixed a bug that in script binding, if a method returns GVariant, the result will be wrongly converted to an object.
<{/autoul}>

<{autoul}>
	Added new meta data definition syntax. Now no macro is required to build the meta data.

<{/autoul}>

<h3>2011-12-10 version 1.1.0 </h3>

	Fixed memory leak in GScopedInterface when call "reset" with same pointer.
	Fixed a bug that can't access a member object's member in script binding. (a.b.c = 1 will cause a.b be copied, now a.b is referenced)
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2011-11-27 version 1.0.1 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Refactored Lua binding, using better and faster algorithm to travel for data and methods.
	Distinguish static and member data access in Lua binding.
	Add: class GMetaClassTraveller in gmetaclasstraveller.h to ease iterating class hierarchy.

	Bug fix: binding Lua operators to wrong meta table.
	Bug fix: Lua passes two parameters to __unm operator that cpgf doesn't handle correctly.
	Bug fix: some exceptions raised by interface API were not detected in Lua binding. Now re-throw it to Lua.
	Memory leak fix: leak when exception is raised during any Lua callback.
	Remove: function getMethodList and getMethodListInHierarchy from GMetaClass and IMetaClass. They were replaced with better algorithm.
