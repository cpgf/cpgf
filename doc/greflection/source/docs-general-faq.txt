<{sh id="exception_safety"}> What's the exception safety in cpgf library?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
The library provides basic exception safety. That's to say, when exception occurs, no memory leak, and the object is not garbled.
However, it's hard to guarantee the exceptio safety. So if you find anything that's not exception safety, let me know.

<{sh id="thread_safety"}> What's the thread safety in cpgf library?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
The library is not safe for writting at the same time in multiple thread.
Due the static objects and lazy meta data building, before the static objects intializes and lazy occurs. reading from multiple thread is not safe.
But when all static objects initializes and lazy occurs, reading is safe in multiple thread.

For example, if you get a meta method in one thread, calling the method in several threads at the same time should be safe.

However, the library is not tested in multiple threads environment yet, so take your own risk.

<{sh id="improve_document"}> Some of the library document is bad, I want to help to rephrase it, but how can I help?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
First, any intention of helping the library is appreciated.
Second, about the documentation.
I wrote a script to parse my own defined document format to create the document.
So it's hard for anyone else to edit the document source file directly unless you want to learn my own format.

To help to improve the document, you just need to copy the paragraph, or the whole text, from the web page, edit it in a text editor, then send the revision back to me by email.
You can find my gmail address in the About page.

Note: you can only help to improve the content, not the format.

<{sgroup}> Reflection


<{sh id="return_reference_to_temp"}> When I build meta data for method, why the compiler issues warning like returning reference to temporary object?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
This is because either the parameter, or the return value, is a reference-to-const to an object which can be constructed implicitly from a fundamental (int, char, etc) type or pointer or reference to a fundamental type.
For example, if we have this method,
<{piece}>void setName(const std::string & name); <{/piece}>
std::string can be constructed implicitly from const char *.

When this kind of method is reflected, GVariant will try to return reference to local temporary object.
That warning is dangerous, it may crash your program.
To solve this issue, use policy GMetaPolicyCopyAllConstReference.
That policy will force the parameter or return value being passed by value instead of reference.

<{piece}>._method("setName", &setName, GMetaPolicyCopyAllConstReference()) <{/piece}>

<{sgroup}> Script binding (Lua and Google V8 Javascript)

<{sh id="when_use_bindMethod_and_bindMethodList"}> When should I use bindMethod and bindMethodList?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
If you are only binding classes, never you need to call bindMethod or bindMethodList.
cpgf will bind all class members automatically.

bindMethod and bindMethodList are useful if you want to bind methods to global scope under current script object.

<{/autobr}>


<{sh id="why_v8_is_old"}> Why the Google V8 binding is based on an old version V8 (v3.4.5)?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
First, the V8 version used in cpgf is not very old. It should be already stable version.
Second, the reason cpgf doesn't use an up to date V8 version is that, V8 is always using some exotic building system, from Scons to gyp, rather than makefile or CMake, which is widely accepted by C++ world.
It's very hard to get those weird building system working correctly under MS VC and MinGW, both of which are used to develop cpgf.
You may check the user comments on V8 web page <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/BuildingOnWindows" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/BuildingWithGYP" target="_blank">here</a> to see how other V8 users said.
The total time I wasted on building V8 is much longer than total time I spent on building wxWidgets and Qt.
I would like to invest my time on more valuable works, rather than building a third party library.
So let's stick with current V8 version 3.4.5, until the future V8 is not compatible with it.
