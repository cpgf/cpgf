<h1>Building and use cpgf library</h1>

<h3>Using the library </h3>
<{autool}>
	In the project setting, add an include path pointing to "cpgf/include".
	Link the source code or link the library in your project.	
	All classes, functions and APIs are in the namespace "cpgf".
<{/autool}>
	

<h3>Link the source code </h3>
<{autobr}>
	To using the library, the easiest way is to just link all .cpp source code
	under the src and sub folder.
	However, a build script is also provided to build the code as static library.
	
<{/autobr}>

<h3>Build the library </h3>
<{autobr}>
	The library uses CMake as the build system.
	A makefile is provided to wrap the CMake build.
	To build the library, open command line terminal, go to folder "build",
	
	run
		make PLATFORM
		
	PLATFORM can be one of
		nmake mingw linux vc05 vc08 vc10 cb_mingw cb_nmake cb_linux
		
	For detailed PLATFORM information, run "make" without parameter to see
	the help.
	
	If you are using MSVC, run "nmake" instead of "make".

	To build with Lua binding, you must change the variable LUA_DIR
	in build.config.txt to point to the source code of Lua.
